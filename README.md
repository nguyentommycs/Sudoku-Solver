# Sudoku-Solver

Fill in the grid by clicking on the square and pressing a number on your keyboard. Use **delete** to erase a square.

Press **Space** to solve the puzzle while showing the process. The display will take a bit of time but it's cool to watch!

Press **Enter** to solve the puzzle instantly. There won't be any animation here, but this drastically reduces the amount of time. 

If you enter a puzzle that doesn't have a solution, the final grid will simply return to the initial state.
